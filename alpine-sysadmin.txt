rc {runlevel}

boot – Generally the only services you should add to the boot runlevel are those
    which deal with the mounting of filesystems, set the initial state of 
    attached peripherals and logging. Hotplugged services are added to the boot 
    runlevel by the system. All services in the boot and sysinit runlevels are 
    automatically included in all other runlevels except for those listed here.
    
single – Stops all services except for those in the sysinit runlevel.
reboot – Changes to the shutdown runlevel and then reboots the host.
shutdown – Changes to the shutdown runlevel and then halts the host.
default – Used if no runlevel is specified. (This is generally the runlevel you 
    want to add services to.)

It appears that 'runlevel' here refers to the state of the system - turning on, 
running, or turning off / rebooting. Assign a daemon to 'shutdown' if you want 
it to run every time the system shuts down.
